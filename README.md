Useg picks a category, then the programm randomly chooses a word from that category.
Uses guesses letters, if the word has that letter, program shows it (E.g. hidden word is "glasses", the guessed letter is "s" then the console will show ***ss*s). If the used fails to guess the word after some trials, game ends
